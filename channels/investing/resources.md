    > I really like KPP Financial for absolute straight beginners…..it’s a daily podcast and I have called several times and had my questions answered on the podcast…..I don’t really recommend options trading to people anymore unless you’re going to invest a year or so of learning into it…..All of Ben Stein’s books are incredible on saving for retirement….I’d also highly recommend learning technical analysis and fundamental analysis of stocks via books
