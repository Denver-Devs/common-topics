### Definitions

A contractor is a person or company that performs work on a contract basis.

*Contract to Hire*

Contract-to-Hire agreements outline a set length of time a contractor will work for the employer. At the end of that set period, the employer decides if the contractor will be hired as a permanent employee or dismiss the contractor.

#### Pros-Cons

- Contractor
  - Pros
    - Freedom. You decide when, where and how you work. If you cannot decide this, you may be improperly classified as a contractor when you are in fact an employee. [4](http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/misclassification-of-employees-as-independent-contractors/)
    - Allowed additional itemized deductions when filing income taxes. [5](https://payable.com/blog/1099-tax-deductions)
    - You're paid for hours worked (no exempt pay in contracting!) and get that on your paycheck.
    - You decide how and what to set aside for taxes.
    - Generally retain rights for creation of intellectual property.
  - Cons
    - Additional administrative burden in keeping track of hours worked, business-related expenses for tax deductions, and tax payments that will need to be made (income tax, employment tax, etc...).
    - Generally no benefits (health, retirement) packaged in term of contract work.
    - Pay an additional 7.65% of employment taxes (FICA) that would otherwise be paid by the employer.
    - Consistently sell new work.
---
- Contract-to-Hire
  - Pros
    - Opportunity to "try out" the company
  - Cons
    - Difficulty in comparing the contract rate versus salary at hire point
---
- Employee
  - Pros
    - Only pay employee portion of FICA, Medicare.
    - Easier to obtain benefits via company than as an independent contractor (often better/cheaper too).
    - Expectation of consistent work, as opposed to having to find your own as a contractor.
  - Cons
    - Your employer controls what you do, how you do it, and when you do it.
    - Cannot deduct reimbursed business expenses on tax returns.
    - Intellectual property created is generally property of the employer.

#### Tax Implications

Rules of thumb

> Double the hourly rate and add three zeroes for an annual salary equivalent. $50/hour -> $100k. Caveat: doesnâ€™t include health insurance or time off.

> Consider the invisible benefits of employment when considering contract work such as health care, paid time off, retirement matching etc...
