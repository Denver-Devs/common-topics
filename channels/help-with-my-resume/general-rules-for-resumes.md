### TL;DR, who reads now days anyways?
- General Rules
    - Make the resume fit either one full page, or two full pages. None of that 1 and 1/3 pages crap, it hurts my eyes. Dont do it.

- Header
    - Name
    - City/State
    - Phone/Email
    - Sites [GitHub, LinkedIn, Personal Site, Portfolio Site]

- Summary
    - Concisely summarize how your experience connects you to what you're applying for

- Skills
    - If you're going for a skills-based approach, include a matrix/table/list... thing... of some sort that isn't ugly and clearly defines your *relevant* skills.

- Projects
    - You can include some projects here if you like; however this tends to bloat resumes.. so be prepared to make your resume a full two pages if you're going to do this.

- Experience
    - List all the jobs you've had and left because you had a self-loathing that you attributed to your work but you couldn't just look in the mirror and fix your alcoholism.
    - Don't forget to describe actionably how it's impressive and relevant to the applied for job.

- Education
    - This may or may not be relevant depending on where you're at in your career.
    
- Interests
    - Only do this if you're interesting. If you're not, leave it out... like I do...
